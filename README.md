# Airsoft Game Timer

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based Airsoft Game Timer. It supports multiple game modes and is designed for DIY use. Commercial use is prohibited (see LICENSE).
Wiki pages are also available, check documentation periodacially. https://github.com/alevike/Airsoft-Game-Timer/wiki

## Order the Assembled & Tested Airsoft Timer Board

If you prefer not to build it yourself, you can order a custom-made, assembled, and preprogrammed Airsoft Timer PCB â€” ready to use out of the box.
Simply drop me an email at airsofttimer[at]gmail[dot]com to discuss options, availability, and pricing.

## Uploading Firmware to the Timer Board (*or Arduino Mega)
You can upload the latest firmware to your Airsfot Timer board via FTDI adapter using `avrdude` and the wiring protocol. This method preserves the bootloader.

### Requirements
- **Timer Board (*or Arduino Mega)**
- **ISP programmer or Arduino as ISP**
- **avrdude** (AVR Downloader/UploaDEr)
- **Latest firmware HEX file** (from the Releases section)

### Download avrdude
- Official site: [https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/)
- Windows users: Download the ZIP from [https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/releases](https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude/releases)
- Extract the ZIP to a folder, e.g. `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\avrdude`

### Download the Latest Firmware
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/alevike/Airsoft-Game-Timer/releases) page of this repository.
2. Download the latest `firmware.hex` file.
3. Place `firmware.hex` in the same folder as `avrdude.exe`.

### Upload Procedure
1. Connect your Board to your PC via ISP (or use Arduino as ISP).
2. Open a command prompt or PowerShell in the folder where `avrdude.exe` and `firmware.hex` are located.
3. Run the following command (replace `COM12` with your actual port):

```powershell
./avrdude.exe -D -c wiring -p m2560 -P COM12 -b 115200 -U flash:w:firmware.hex:i
```

- `-D` disables chip erase (preserves bootloader)
- `-c wiring` uses the wiring/Arduino ISP protocol
- `-p m2560` specifies the Mega 2560 chip
- `-P COM12` is your serial port (check Device Manager)
- `-b 115200` is the baud rate
- `-U flash:w:firmware.hex:i` writes the firmware

### Notes
- Make sure your programmer and wiring are correct.
- If you get errors, try lowering the baud rate (e.g., `-b 19200`).
- The bootloader will not be erased with this method.
